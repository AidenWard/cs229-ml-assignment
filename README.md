# About this Repo
This repo contains my solution of assignment in On Demand Coursera course on `Machine Learning` by Professor Andrew NG. If you are taking the class, please DO NOT refer any code in my repo before the due date and NEVER post any code in my repo according to "Stanford Honer Code" and "Coursera Honor Code" below. Questions or pointing out is always welcome, please send me a mail.

## Stanford Honor Code

> "We strongly encourage students to form study groups,  and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However,  the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises,  you are welcome to discuss them with other students,  discuss specific algorithms,  properties of algorithms,  etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student,  nor show your solution code to other students."

## Coursera Honor Code
> All students participating in the class must agree to abide by the following code of conduct:
>    
>    I will register for only one account.
>    My answers to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).
>    I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments available to anyone else (except to the extent an assignment explicitly permits sharing solutions). This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any solutions provided by the course staff or others.
>    I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve or hurt the results of others.
